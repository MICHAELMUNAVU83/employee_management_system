## Technologies

I used `Elixir ` and `Phoenix Live View` .

## Setup

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
